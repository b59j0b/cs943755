Introduction to Operating Systems CS-GY6233
COURSE OVERVIEW 
This course   introduces   basic   issues   in operating systems. Topics: Threads,   processes,   concurrency,   memory   management,   I/O Control, and case studies.
Prerequisite: Graduate standing.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
By the end of this   course, students   should   be   able   to:
● Understand   modern operating systems structure
●         Apply   process   management concepts, and   be able to   design,   implement and evaluate   multiprocessing(or multithreading) systems
●         Apply   memory   management concepts, and   be able to   design,   implement and evaluate virtual   memory organizations.
● Understand file systems and   I/O   mechanisms.
●          Understand   multiprocessor architectures, and   be able   to design and   evaluate the   performance   of multiprocessor operating systems.
● Apply   real-time system scheduling   mechanism.
● Design system   protection and security   concepts.
COURSE STRUCTURE 
This course   is conducted entirely online,   which   means   you   do   not   have   to   be   on   campus   to   complete any   portion of   it. You will   participate   in the   course   using   Brightspace   located   at https://brightspace.nyu.edu.
LEARNING TIME RUBRIC

*Asynchronous   learning   is defined as any   non-realtime student   learning,   such   as
recorded   lecture,   podcast,   interactive   module, articles, websites, etc. This also   includes   any student-to-student or faculty-to-student communication that   may   happen with   an      asynchronous tool, such as discussion   board, chatroom,   e-mail,   text,   etc.**Synchronous   learning   is defined as any   real-time student-to-student   and/or faculty-to-student   learning, such as a   live webinar session   or   other   video/audio   communication service.
COURSE COMMUNICATION 
WEEKLY VIRTUAL OFFICE HOURS 
The Teaching Assistant   (TA) will   be available for weekly virtual   office   hours   by   appointment. To schedule an appointment with your TA, or   to   ask   any   questions   about   the   course   content,   please   email them.

Quizzes 
All of the active   learning   modules contain   knowledge checks   to   assess   your   understanding   of the   material.    You can take these as   many times   as   you   like   and   are   not   part   of your   grade. Some   of the active   learning   modules   have a   paired quiz   in   Brightspace.    This   quiz   can   be taken   as   many times as you   like and the grade from   the   last   take   will   be   used.
Assignments
In the first   half of the course, students will   work   on   programming   assignments   to   implement   operating system algorithms covered   in the active   learning   modules   and   readings.
Discussions 
Brightspace will   have threaded discussion topics where you   can   interact   on   lectures, assignments, or the   related   research   project.    Students are expected   to   respond   to   each   discussion   prompt and   reply to two fellow students'   responses.
Research 
Each student will   pick a specific,   applied technical   problem   related to   the   material   in   the   course.   The student will then   hypothesize   a solution to   the   problem.      Using   tools   such   as   google   scholar,   the student will   research-related articles,   hypothesize a solution   and   gather   initial   evidence.
Each student will write-up their   results as   a   2   page   extended   abstract   and will   create   a   recording   of their   presentation of these   materials to other students.
